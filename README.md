# Accessible Component Library

This repository contains a growing set of **accessible, framework-agnostic UI components**, designed with:

- **Semantic HTML**
- **Robust keyboard support**
- **Screen reader-friendly markup**
- **WCAG 2.2 / EN 301 549 awareness**
- A focus on **neuro-inclusive, low-friction user experiences**

Components are implemented in vanilla HTML/CSS (and minimal JavaScript where needed) so they can be understood and reused across different tech stacks.

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide **clear, copy-paste-friendly examples** of accessible UI components
- Show **how** and **why** each component is implemented in a certain way
- Map components to relevant **WCAG 2.2** and **EN 301 549** criteria
- Demonstrate **keyboard and screen reader behavior**
- Offer **good vs. bad** examples where useful
- Serve as a resource for teams building **accessible design systems**
